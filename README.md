# ![](./Presentations/bootcamp.png) ODM bootcamp 

This repo contains the presentation, hands-on exercises and solutions that support a quick ramp-up on IBM Operational Decision Manager.

In the [Labs](./Labs) folder, you will find 2 labs:

- The **Loyalty** lab provides detailed, step-by-step guidance on creating your first ODM project.
- The **Mortgage** lab is purposely more vague and requires that you discover and create the object model and the rules as you understand them from the given requirements. 

Both labs have a proposed implementation in the [Solutions](./Labs/Solutions) folder.
